# nosql-challenge

This challenge involved using MongoDB to evaluate a database of UK food establishments. After importing the necessary data and libraries, an instance of Mongo Client was established. I used MongoDB Compass to inspect the data. I made the suggested modifications and additions to the database. I also changed the data types from strings to numerical values for the RatingValue, longitude, and latitude fields.
* I successfully deleted the documents that contained Dover as the local authority. When I initially ran the query to identify establishments which had Dover as the local authority, I obtained a count of those documents. After deleting them, I was not able to retrieve the original count.
In the 2nd Jupyter Notebook, various queries were run to analyze data in the uk_food database. Dataframes were created using Pandas. For question #3, I originally tried to use Geospatial Query Operators to locate restaurants within a certain geographical range. That unfortunately did not work. I consulted Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack Overflow and decided to use Logical Query Operators to solve that problem. I obtained those methods from the MongoDB documentation and used the class exercises as a guide to doing this challenge.
